## Development server

Run `npm run local` for a dev server. This will run a mocked api server (via nodemon) and build & serve the Angular application. A browser window will open automatically, but in case it doesn't, navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
